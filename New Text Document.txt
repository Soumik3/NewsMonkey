if we add target="_blank" in a tag,then the link will open in a new tab
there is 12 grids per row,if we do md3 then we can add 4 cols and for md4 we can add 3 col....In this.state.articles if we want to loop through we have to add a unique key in tag.
WE have used Constructor to set the initial state,
then by using componentDidMount we will set the state before render.
Constructor first,then Render will exectued then componentDidMount
WE have to start a vairble with REACT_APP name to get Aceess

We used hooks to use the classbase features in func base without writing class base component
like useState is similar to setState
useEffect is similar to componentDidMount(it will trigger the render method after it)
